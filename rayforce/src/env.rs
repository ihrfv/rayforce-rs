//! Binding native functions into the global environment.
//!
//! A name bound here is callable from Rayfall source — and, more usefully, from
//! a *remote* peer. When a q publisher pushes `` (`upd; payload) `` down an
//! attached [`crate::q::Subscription`], the event loop looks `upd` up in this
//! environment and calls whatever it finds. Binding a Rust function under that
//! name is how pushed data reaches Rust.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rayforce::{env, Runtime, Value};
//!
//! struct OnUpd;
//! impl env::VaryFn for OnUpd {
//!     fn call(args: env::Args<'_>) -> Value {
//!         println!("pushed frame with {} argument(s)", args.len());
//!         Value::null()      // an async push expects no reply
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let _rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
//! env::bind_vary::<OnUpd>("upd").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a trait and not a closure
//!
//! The core takes a bare C function pointer with no user-data argument, so
//! there is nowhere to put a closure's captured environment. Binding a *type*
//! instead sidesteps that: each `H` gets its own monomorphized trampoline, so
//! the function address itself carries the identity that a data pointer
//! normally would. State that a handler needs lives in statics.
//!
//! The trampoline also owns the parts that are easy to get wrong — borrowing
//! the argument array without taking ownership of it, and catching a panic
//! before it can unwind into C — so implementors write ordinary safe Rust.
