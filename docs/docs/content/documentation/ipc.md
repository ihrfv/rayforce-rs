# :material-network: IPC — Inter-Process Communication

`rayforce` ships a TCP **client** for talking to a running RayforceDB server over
RayforceDB's native IPC protocol. This lets you run queries on a remote (or
local) RayforceDB instance and exchange `Value`s with it.

!!! note "Assume a live runtime"
    ```rust
    use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient, Value};
    // every snippet below runs inside:
    Runtime::scope(|rt| { /* … */ })?;
    ```

## :material-server: Running a server

The client connects to a RayforceDB server process. Start one by running the
`rayforce` binary in server mode with `-p PORT`:

```sh
rayforce -p 5000
```

The server now listens for IPC connections on port `5000`.

!!! info "Embedded server is planned"
    An embedded `TcpServer` you can run from within Rust is planned but **not yet
    available** in the bindings. For now, run the standalone `rayforce` binary as
    shown above.

## :material-lan-connect: Connecting

Create a client with `TcpClient::connect(host, port, user, password)`. Pass empty
strings for `user` / `password` when the server requires no authentication. The
call returns `Result<TcpClient>`, so a failed connection is an error you handle.

```rust
use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient};
Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
    let client = TcpClient::connect("127.0.0.1", 5000, "", "")?;
    Ok(())
})?;
# Ok::<(), rayforce::RayError>(())
```

The connection is **closed on drop** — when the `TcpClient` goes out of scope the
socket is released. You can also close it explicitly with `client.close()`.

## :material-database-search: Executing queries

`execute(query)` sends a Rayfall source string to the server, runs it there, and
returns the result as a `Value`.

```rust
use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient};
Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
    let client = TcpClient::connect("127.0.0.1", 5000, "", "")?;

    // A scalar result.
    let sum = client.execute("(+ 1 2)")?;
    assert_eq!(sum.as_i64()?, 3);

    // A vector result, read back zero-copy.
    let v = client.execute("(til 5)")?;
    assert_eq!(v.as_slice::<i64>()?, &[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);
    Ok(())
})?;
# Ok::<(), rayforce::RayError>(())
```

Server-side errors come back as a `Result::Err`:

```rust
use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient};
Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
    let client = TcpClient::connect("127.0.0.1", 5000, "", "")?;

    assert!(client.execute("(undefined_symbol_xyz)").is_err());
    Ok(())
})?;
# Ok::<(), rayforce::RayError>(())
```

## :material-send: Sending values

To send a `Value` (rather than a source string), use `send`. It transmits the
value to the server, waits for the response, and returns it as a `Value`:

```rust
use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient, Value};
Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
    let client = TcpClient::connect("127.0.0.1", 5000, "", "")?;

    let payload = Value::vec(&[1i64, 2, 3]);
    let reply = client.send(&payload)?;
    Ok(())
})?;
# Ok::<(), rayforce::RayError>(())
```

For fire-and-forget messages where you do not need a reply, `send_async` sends a
value and returns immediately:

```rust
use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient, Value};
Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
    let client = TcpClient::connect("127.0.0.1", 5000, "", "")?;

    client.send_async(&Value::sym("ping"))?;   // returns () on success
    Ok(())
})?;
# Ok::<(), rayforce::RayError>(())
```

## :material-code-tags: A full example

```rust
use rayforce::{Runtime, TcpClient};

fn main() -> rayforce::Result<()> {
    Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
        // Connect to a server started with: rayforce -p 5000
        let client = TcpClient::connect("127.0.0.1", 5000, "", "")?;

        // Run a query remotely.
        let result = client.execute("(+ 1 2)")?;
        println!("server says: {}", result.as_i64()?);

        // The connection closes automatically when `client` is dropped.
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

## :material-rss: Subscribing to a push feed

`TcpClient` and `QConnection` are both request/response: you ask, the server
answers. A *subscription* inverts that — you ask once, and the peer pushes for
the rest of the day. The blocking clients cannot express it, because a frame the
peer pushes unsolicited would be read as the answer to your next call.

The fix is to give the socket to the event loop. `Poll` is that loop; attaching
a connection to it means the loop owns the reads and routes each frame by
message type — a response wakes the call parked on it, and anything else is
dispatched to the function the publisher named. You bind that name.

```rust,no_run
use rayforce::{env, q::QConnection, Poll, Runtime, Value};

// The push handler. A kdb+ tickerplant sends `(`upd;`trade;tbl)` — two
// arguments — while a dict-form publisher sends `(`upd;dict)` — one. Binding
// it *vary* is what lets one build serve both: a fixed arity does not error,
// it silently drops every frame from the other kind of peer.
struct OnUpd;

impl env::VaryFn for OnUpd {
    fn call(args: env::Args<'_>) -> Value {
        println!("batch with {} argument(s)", args.len());
        Value::null()        // an async push expects no reply
    }
}

fn main() -> rayforce::Result<()> {
    Runtime::scope(|_rt| {
        let poll = Poll::install()?;
        env::bind_vary::<OnUpd>("upd")?;

        let sub = QConnection::connect("127.0.0.1", 5010)?.attach(&poll)?;
        sub.execute(".u.sub[`trade;`]")?;

        // A disconnect is not an error and does not interrupt the loop: the
        // peer simply stops resolving. Slice the loop and check between slices,
        // or a process whose connection was reaped sits there looking healthy
        // while receiving nothing.
        while sub.is_alive() {
            poll.run_for(200)?;   // `on_upd` fires from inside here
        }
        println!("peer disconnected");
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

!!! note "A handler is a type, not a closure"

    The core takes a bare C function pointer with no user-data argument, so
    there is nowhere to put a closure's captures. Binding a *type* sidesteps
    that — each handler gets its own monomorphized trampoline, so the function
    address carries the identity a data pointer normally would. State a handler
    needs lives in statics.

    The trampoline owns what is easy to get wrong: it borrows the argument
    array without taking ownership, and catches a panic before it can unwind
    into C, replying null instead. So one malformed frame cannot wedge the
    stream, and implementors write ordinary safe Rust.

!!! note "Teardown order"

    Closing a selector releases engine objects held for it, so a `Subscription`
    must die before the event loop it runs on. `Subscription` borrows its
    `Poll`, so the compiler enforces that half for you.

    The other half the scope enforces. The loop belongs to the `Runtime` and is
    torn down with it, and both `Poll` and `Subscription` are `!Send` — so
    `Runtime::scope`'s bound refuses to let either leave the closure. The
    `is_current()` check on every `Poll` method is for the one route the type
    system cannot see, a `thread_local!` stash: a handle that gets out that way
    stops working rather than touching a destroyed loop.
