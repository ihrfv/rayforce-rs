//! 1. Locates the RayforceDB v2 core + `rayforce-q` source trees. Both ship
//!    inside this crate as git submodules under `vendor/` (see [`core_src_dir`]
//!    / [`q_src_dir`]), so a build never touches the network — docs.rs and
//!    other sandboxes have none.
//! 2. Stages the core into `OUT_DIR` ([`stage_core`]) and builds the static
//!    library `librayforce.a` there via the core's `make lib` (incremental — a
//!    no-op when objects are up to date).
//! 3. Emits the static link directives.
//! 4. Generates Rust bindings with `bindgen`, from the core's public header
//!    plus the private ones declaring [`INTERNAL_FNS`].
